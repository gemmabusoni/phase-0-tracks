# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Keeping various versions of software/code organized; in case you make a mistake or want to see previous versions.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is part of the code or software. It could hold a portion of code or an edit/add-on. It's good to use so you don't make accidental mistakes in the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is an add-on to a piece of code. A good commit message is descriptive and briefly tells what the change is.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when a PR is not merged for whatever reason.
